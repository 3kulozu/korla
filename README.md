# KORLA

**Korla** icon theme is a mix of the following icon sets: *La Capitaine*, *MacOS11* and *Papirus*. It has also brand new icons, Mac specific have been replaced and dozen others were redone. To make them showing properly, you may need to update the icon cache. A script is included.

This theme is considered to be in beta version. Many things need to be cleaned up. Use at your own risk.
If someone knows how to make it better or fix what it's not working, help is appreciated.
